## Glossary
1. **Internal stakeholders**: stakeholders that exist inside the business and are directly affected by the project outcome.
2. **External stakeholders**: stakeholders that have an interest in the success of a business but do not have a direct affiliation with the projects at an organization. 
3. **Primary stakeholders**: have the highest level of interest in the outcome of a project because they are directly affected by the outcome. They actively contribute to a project.

5. **Direct stakeholders**: are constantly involved with the activities of the project.
6. **Indirect stakeholders**: are more interested in the outcome and usability of the project rather than the process of completing it.
